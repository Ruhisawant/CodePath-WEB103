## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Our group quickly aligned on a creative idea that was both technically feasible and fun to build. We divided responsibilities efficiently, set up the GitHub repository smoothly, and outlined user stories that clearly matched our core features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
The main challenge was narrowing down our concept. We had several interesting ideas, but balancing creativity with scope required discussion. We also had to carefully design features that met the rubric’s “custom feature” requirements while staying realistic for our timeline.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We’ll likely need guidance on structuring our database relationships efficiently, especially for handling user investments and daily price updates. Help with optimizing our API design and ensuring smooth frontend-backend integration during deployment would also be valuable.
