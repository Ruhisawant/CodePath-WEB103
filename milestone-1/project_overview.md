## 📝 Description and Purpose
SnackEconomy turns snack fandom into a playful investment simulation. Users start with a set amount of virtual currency and invest in snack companies whose prices change daily. The goal is to manage your snack portfolio, make smart investments, and climb the leaderboard of the most profitable investors.  

This project blends fun with finance, giving users an engaging way to understand basic investment logic through a creative and lighthearted theme.

## 💡 Inspiration
I wanted to make something that mixes humor with strategy. Finance simulations can be intimidating, so I thought: what if users could invest in snacks instead of stocks? By replacing complex market data with familiar products, we can make learning about investing fun and accessible.  

SnackEconomy is about turning “junk food cravings” into fake profits and friendly competition.
